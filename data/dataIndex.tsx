We would love for families and neighbors to come help assemble the kits.  Lifting Hands International will provide the boxes for us to store the kits, but we will need some manpower and trucks to help take the boxes to their warehouse in American Fork.  If you could help by having a truck or two (or trailer) per ward and some people to help drive them that would be appreciated.  We expect to have about 200 boxes (33 per ward) to transport.\n\nThank you so much for helping in this great opportunity to come together and to serve.  We know this is an ambitious request but with faith and love we know Heavenly Father will provide a way and this will be a great project to be a part of.",
